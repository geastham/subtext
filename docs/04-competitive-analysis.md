# Competitive Analysis & Market Positioning

## Market Landscape Overview

The conversation coaching space is emerging at the intersection of three major trends:
1. **AI-powered dating assistance** (growing rapidly)
2. **Privacy-first consumer apps** (reaction to data scandals)
3. **Mental health & relationship wellness** (Gen Z priority)

Currently, no product combines all three effectively. This creates a unique opportunity for Subtext to own this niche.
