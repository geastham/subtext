# Product Vision & Core Thesis

## Executive Summary

**Subtext** is a privacy-first, on-device conversation coach for Gen Z that transforms how young people navigate dating and relationships. By providing AI-powered guidance for text conversations, Subtext empowers users to communicate more authentically, set healthy boundaries, and build meaningful connections—all while keeping their most personal conversations completely private.

## Core Problem Statement

### The Dating Communication Crisis

Gen Z is experiencing what we call **"The Communication Gap"**—a disconnect between the deeper connections they crave and their ability to initiate them:

- **84%** of Gen Z daters want to find new ways to build deeper connections (Hinge 2025 D.A.T.E. Report)
- **36%** more hesitant than millennials to begin deep conversations on first dates
- **65%** believe conversation is a lost art (Plenty of Fish Conversation Nation Survey)
- **61%** believe technology has impacted their ability to have meaningful face-to-face conversations

### Current User Behavior

Gen Z is already solving this problem in an ad-hoc way:
- Copy-pasting conversations into ChatGPT for advice
- Asking friends to help craft replies
- Overthinking messages for hours, leading to anxiety and missed opportunities
- Struggling to identify red flags and unhealthy communication patterns

### The Privacy Problem

Current solutions require:
- Sharing intimate conversations with third-party servers
- Trusting that personal data won't be stored, analyzed, or monetized
- Accepting that conversations may be used to train AI models
- Exposing vulnerable moments to potential data breaches

## Our Solution: Subtext

### Product Philosophy

Subtext operates on three core principles:

1. **Privacy First**: Your conversations never leave your device. Period.
2. **Empowerment, Not Replacement**: We coach, not script. Users learn to communicate better over time.
3. **Safety-Conscious**: We detect unhealthy patterns and prioritize user wellbeing over "keeping the conversation going."

### Core User Experience

Users can:

1. **Import or paste** any text conversation (iMessage, WhatsApp, Instagram DMs)
2. **Choose their goal**: Reply well, interpret mixed signals, set a boundary, spot red flags, repair conflict
3. **Receive intelligent coaching**:
   - 3 contextual reply options with rationales
   - Tone analysis and relationship dynamics insights
   - Safety flags for manipulation, coercion, or unhealthy patterns
   - Follow-up questions to clarify missing context
4. **Refine and personalize**: Edit suggestions, regenerate with different parameters, build a personal style over time
