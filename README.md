# Subtext

**A Privacy-First, On-Device Conversation Coach for Gen Z**

Subtext is an iOS app that helps Gen Z daters communicate more authentically and confidently in their text conversations—all while keeping their most personal messages completely private on their device.

## 🎯 The Problem

Gen Z is struggling with digital communication:
- **84%** want deeper connections but are hesitant to start meaningful conversations
- **61%** believe technology has hurt their ability to communicate
- Many already paste conversations into ChatGPT for advice (privacy nightmare!)

## 💡 Our Solution

Subtext provides instant, intelligent coaching for text conversations:
- ✅ **100% On-Device**: Your conversations never leave your iPhone
- ✅ **AI-Powered**: Leverages Apple's Foundation Models for smart suggestions
- ✅ **Safety-First**: Detects red flags and unhealthy communication patterns
- ✅ **Empowering**: Helps you become a better communicator, not dependent on AI
